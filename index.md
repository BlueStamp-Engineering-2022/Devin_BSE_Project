# Phone Controlled Robot Arm
The project that I have been building is a phone controlled robot arm. This robot arm is able to move around in many different ways to make it reach a point. This robot arm is very useful, because it can be used wirelessly controlled using bluetooth.

# Final Milestone - Making my own app
My third and final milestone was adding some modifications, the modifications that I added is to make my own app. With this app there are labels for each slider to move it every direction the robot can go. The sliders on the app will make the servos move to the position between 1 and 180 to make the servos turn, and make it move. Some parts I struggled with was coding the part of the robot to make it connect from the phone to the robot arm. The parts that I enjoyed on building was working on the app, because I got to choose the interface of my app.

# Second Milestone - Connecting it to a bluetooth device
For my second milestone, I am using a bluetooth chip to connect my android phone to my robot arm. I had to upload some code to my arduino, and download an apk to my android phone to control the arm. I also adjusted some of my screws, because some of them were too tight and the arm couldn't move correctly. The parts I struggled with this was debugging the code to make it work better, and connect smoother. Some things I enjoyed was finding the errors in my physical design, and testing it to make it better. This part of the project, wasn't too hard, and I finished it with few challenges≥

# First Milestone - Building the Base 
My first milestone was building and screwing in every part of the robot arm. This was my start to my intensive project, to start I had to look for the instructions to build the device, but I had found the wrong one multiple times. Then after 15 minutes I found the correct tutorial. So I started to assemble, partially through the build, I realized that I was using larger screws than I was supposed to, so what I did is I disassembled all of the progress that I had made and reassembled it. The most fun part was assembling the wires for me, and the most challenging part was screwing the screws to make it. But the hardest part of this project for me was to screw all the screws in, because I had to hold the wrench and component in one hand and hold the screwdriver and screw it in with the other hand. Overall, this project posed some challenges to me, but I got over them and finished with success.

# Starter Project - TV-B-Gone
My starter project was making a TV-B-Gone with this device you can rurn off almost any TV. To prepare for this project, I found the instructions to build it, and I also learned how to solder componenets to a board. To start this project, I took all of the components out of the bag. one by one I soldered each pin of the components, and slowly it all came together. Most parts of the parts were easy to solder, but they were a lot of pins that I had to solder, and it took a long time. The hardest part of this prokect for me was to solder the battery pack in, because it took me a long time to not make the wires fray. This project, was very fun for me, and posed a decent challenge for me to get over.
