# Phone Controlled Robot Arm
The project that I have been building is a phone controlled robot arm. This robot arm is able to move around in many different ways to make it reach a point. This robot arm is very
useful, because it can be used wirelessly controlled using bluetooth.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone - Connecting it to a bluetooth device
For my second milestone, I am using a bluetooth chip to connect my android phone to my robot arm. I had to upload some different code to the bot, but for some of it I had to change, because it didnt work the most efficient for my robot arm. I also adjusted some of my screws, because some of them were too tight and the arm couldn't move correctly. I also tightened some to make the screws such as the one that is holding the claw, because it was loose.

# First Milestone - Building the Base 
My first milestone was building and screwing in everypart of the robot arm. This was my start to my intensive project, to start I had to look for the instructions to build the device, but I had found the wront one multiple times. Then after 15 minutes I found the correct tutorial. So I started to assemble, partially through the build, I realized that I was using larger screws than I was supposed to, so what I did is I disassembled all of the progress that I had made and reassembled it. The most fun part was assembling the wires for me, and the most challenging part was screwing the screws to make it. But the hardest part of this project for me was to screw all the screws in, because I had to hold the wrench and component in one hand and hold the screwdriver and screw it in with the other hand. Overall, this project posed some challenges to me, but I got over them and finished with success.

# Starter Project - TV-B-Gone
My starter project was making a TV-B-Gone with this device you can rurn off almost any TV. To prepare for this project, I found the instructions to build it, and I also learned how to solder componenets to a board. To start this project, I took all of the components out of the bag. one by one I soldered each pin of the components, and slowly it all came together. Most parts of the parts were easy to solder, but they were a lot of pins that I had to solder, and it took a long time. The hardest part of this prokect for me was to solder the battery pack in, because it took me a long time to not make the wires fray. This project, was very fun for me, and posed a decent challenge for me to get over.
